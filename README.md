# Euchre Online
### by Shawn Clary

This project was created using the MERN stack. It's currently one player with plans to utilize the back-end for a future multiplayer version. This is a beta version and only works on desktop/laptop size screens for now with plans to create a mobile app soon.

I'm still making fine-tuning tweaks to the opponent/teammate AI, though I feel like that will *always* be the case. Card game AI is hard!

I'll also be adding a home page with rules and all that, but if you know how to play, give it a whirl! There may be a bug or two has I hammer this thing out. It's not perfect yet, but still fun and works great!
